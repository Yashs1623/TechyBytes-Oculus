## Our Vision:
Food logs or journals are a great way of checking-in with yourself on
what you are eating day-to-day. Itâ€™s not intended as a way to catch you out, but a way to get a clear idea on where you might start when looking at improving your diet. A food logging app which takes images of food items as input and tracks the daily food intake. App generates a report at the end of the month. A Web+Mobile App product that caters all the p;ossible needs.
